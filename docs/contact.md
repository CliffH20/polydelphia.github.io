## Steering Committee

Messaging the [Polydelphia Gateway](https://www.facebook.com/Polydelphia) Facebook page is also the best way to get in touch with the steering committee for any other reason. One of us will get back to you as soon as possible!

If you would rather reach out to an individual committee member, you are welcome to, but it may take us a little longer to reply! The current steering committee members are: [Aaron Browne](https://www.facebook.com/aaron0browne), [Michelle Enos](https://www.facebook.com/michelleenos4), [Cerina Gordon](https://www.facebook.com/cerina.gordon), [Cliff Hebner](https://www.facebook.com/cliff.hebner), and [Imani Thomas](https://www.facebook.com/master.biomancer).
